# Todo app on React + Redux
[Demo](https://eddig.github.io/react-todo)

#### Known issues
GitHub not supports SPA out of box and can't process client side urls like `https://eddig.github.io/react-todo/active` as expected. ([more info](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#notes-on-client-side-routing))
